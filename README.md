# Addressing Token Uniformity in Transformers via Singular Value Transformation
UAI2022: Addressing Token Uniformity in Transformers via Singular Value Transformation 

[Hanqi Yan](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/u2048587/), [Lin Gui](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/lin_gui/), [Wenjie Li](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cswjli/), [Yulan He](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/yulan_he/).

In this work, we characterise the token uniformity problem commonly observed in the output of transformer-based architectures by the degree of skewness in singular value distributions and propose a singular value transformation function (SoftDecay) to address the problem


## Requirements

Our project is based on Huggingface Transformers, so basically you can refer the requirements from [their repository](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). 

### Main Functions

This repo contains 

### Pretrained Language Models + SoftDecay


### Visualization
This part use the .
```
python .py
```
